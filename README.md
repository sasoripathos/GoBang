# GoBang #

The final project of Computer Organization (CSCB58) Summer 2017 in University of Toronto Scarborough. A simple GoBang game implemented on Altera DE2-115 board by Verilog. There are two players and one 16*16 game board. This implementation can only check five chesses in a row or a column (no diagonal). The VGA module is provided by U of T.

For the code, I wrote the Logic Part. Ende Jin wrote the Display Part.

This repository is only used to display the final result. The original repository used during the development is: https://bitbucket.org/DKXXXL/fivesons

Feel free to play with it if you have the hardware. If you are a student in university (especially UofT students), please don't try to use this project in or as your own project without the professor's permission.
